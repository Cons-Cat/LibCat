libCat is a non-POSIX compliant C++26 runtime.
It has no pthreads nor =malloc()=, and by extension no exceptions.
It has type-safe arithmetic, SIMD, fast syscalls, CRTP interfaces,
hierarchical memory allocators, and value-based error handling, among many other features.

* Building
libCat requires a development version of GCC 15 or Clang 20 from the =trunk= branch. Compiling libCat is only routinely tested using =ninja=.
Configuring the build requires CMake 3.29.
#+BEGIN_SRC
  $ cmake -B build/ -G 'Ninja Multi-Config' # or: cmake -B build -GNinja
  $ cmake --build build/  # or: ninja -C build/
  $ ./build/tests/Debug/unit_tests
#+END_SRC

The =.clang-format= and =.clang-tidy= configurations are only compatible with recent builds of clang-tools from the =main= branch.
